			<p>
				A CodeIgniter 4 project for my local high school. The band program has hundreds of pieces spread across the concert and marching band seasons. The current way the music library is, a print out of an outdated spreadsheet in which the source file has been lost, is inefficient. Due to not having the source file, I will be entering all of the pieces by hand. While this will take a while to accomplish, it is worth the extra time in the setup for a less painful end user experience when deployed.

				My PHP skills learned in Franklin University's WEBD-263: Web Information Systems course are being pushed and expanded upon when working on this project. I had not used a PHP framework, so this is helping me learn CodeIgniter along the way too.
