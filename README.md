# WLS Music Database

A CodeIgniter 4 project for my local high school. The band program has hundreds of pieces spread accross the concert and marching band seasons.
The current way the music library is, a print out of an outdated spreadsheet in which the source file has been lost, is ineffiecent. Due to not having the source file,
I will be entering all of the pieces by hand. While this will take a while to accomplish, it is worth the extra time in the setup for a less painful 
enduser experience when deployed.

My PHP skills learned in Franklin University's WEBD-263: Web Infromation Systems course are being pushed and expanded upon when working on this project.
